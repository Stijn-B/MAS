rinsim.core.Simulator, a simple and direct way to interact with the simulator

The simulator is in essence a collection of models. When configuring the simulator, using Simulator.builder(), the
desired models can be added. For ease of use, the simulator contains a TimeModel and a RandomModel by default.
It also has a register() method that allows to register simulation entities into the simulator.
Simulator sim = Simulator.builder()
                         .addModel(...)
                         // add more models
                         .build()

A Model has a generic type T that is called the associated type (or supported type) of a Model. A model that is part of
a simulator, automatically receives all instances of its associated type that are added to the simulator.

PDPGraphRoadModel, simplifies the API for moving vehicles in the PDPTW case as it allows to always just call
moveTo(vehicle,parcel), depending on the state of the parcel this will let the vehicle move to either the pickup
site or the delivery site.
