Project van het vak Multi-Agent Systems

~ ~ Objectives / TODO ~ ~

- Define a concrete pickup-and-delivery problem (environment, AGVs with their capabilities, characteristics of tasks,
scale, communication constraints, dynamism, potential AGV crashes, etc.).

- Develop a multi-agent system for a pickup-and-delivery problem domain using AGVs. This solution should be based on BDI
and delegate MAS. The solution should at least account for both task allocation and route planning.

- Make a thorough scientific study of the behavior of the MAS (following the U-model).
